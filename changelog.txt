-Got the slider working to the point where it updates the current position of the slider based on the
current time of the song.
-Fixed the status bar from not displaying 00:00 time since when stopping it sets the number to a
number less than 0
-The playtime function that updates the song time display previously was called every second even
after hitting stop. It now no longer does this by using the same logic that sets the displayed time to 00:00\
-Fixed the next and previous buttons to as the new logic of using a dictionary to track the song names had
broken them. They now work as they did previously.
-Errors aren't thrown when pressing play/stop/etc. and no songs had been added. This came from the dictionary being checked
for the song name and the dictionary was of course, empty.
-Altered the menu for removing a song to make it more clear that removing a song was removing the last played song.
